# Circumference Calculator :
This is a simple JavaScript project that calculates the circumference of a circle based on the userâ€™s input. I built it to practice working with JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation. The goal was to apply basic concepts in a small but practical way while experimenting with new ideas and improving my problem-solving skills.
